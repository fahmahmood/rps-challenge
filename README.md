Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.

For this exercise I followed from Sam's Week 3 Challenge Exemplar for structure and reiteration of what we learned last week : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyHG6X4R-_cbLEIhC6DnSrg
